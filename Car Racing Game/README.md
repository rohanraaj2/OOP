# Car Racing Game:

You got the task to implement a racing game that has various cars available. The game should be implemented in Python. First, you tackle the cars themself. The cars are instances of classes which form a class hierarchy. This hierarchy can be described as follows:

• Each Car has a current speed, a maximum speed and a definded acceleration.
• After instantiation, each car has a current speed of 0.
• Each Car has an acceleration of 10.0.
• Each Car has a method getSpeed to query the current speed.
• Each Car has the method doAccelerate, which modifies the current speed with the acceleration
value.
• No Car can accelererate beyond its maximum speed.
• There is no possibility to make an instance of Car.
• There is a DefaultCar which has a maximum speed of 200 and a…

(b) (9 Points) Implement (i.e. write the code for) the classes in Java

(c) (6 Points) To test your classes, write a main class and method that instantiates 20 cars in a single array.

The first 10 are default cars, the second 10 are rocket cars. Accelerate each car once and then print its
current speed to the console.
